  "rationale": "The selected profile matches the target criteria more closely than others based on location in a major US tech hub (San Jose, CA) and the relevant experience and education affiliations with SJSU, UROP, Stanford, and Kamco Invest, which align with the given hints. These factors strongly favor the San Jose-based Ayaan Gazali over the other candidates based in Mumbai, who lack the same alignment with the specified experience and location requirements."
